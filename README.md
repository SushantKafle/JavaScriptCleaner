This is a very primitive JavaScript Cleaner. Nothing new, noting big, just coded to pass time :)

*Offers indentations
*Clarity
*No color coding

Can be observed live at: http://sushantkafle.github.io/JavaScriptCleaner/index.html

Took me 2 hrs to completly code and upload it; took longer than initially planned :P
